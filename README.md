# Ruby w/Selenium and RSpec Demo


Hello!

Thanks for checking out my first demo project, an automation of some tests of saucedemo.com via Ruby with Selenium and RSpec. Although it isn't anything fancy, I will be adding to this project regularly as I teach myself new frameworks and methodologies. My first goals are to enhance the scripts with Capybara and to restructure everything to be more modular. 

If you'd like to see a test plan in spreadsheet format for this test automation suite, please take a look at my Notion portfolio at the following link: https://www.notion.so/jennyxblessing/Documentation-Sample-Portfolio-543150f6522641d6a95d063e1acb60c4

Check back soon for more updates!

Happy testing,

Jenny Blessing
