# Ruby w/Selenium and RSpec Demo


Hello!

Thanks for checking out my first demo project, an automation of some tests of saucedemo.com via Ruby with Selenium and RSpec. Although it isn't anything fancy, I will be adding to this project regularly as I teach myself new frameworks and methodologies. My first goals are to enhance the automations with Capybara and restructuring everything to be more modular. Check back soon for updates!

Happy testing,

Jenny Blessing
